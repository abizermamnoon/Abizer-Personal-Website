                I am a Sophomore at Claremont McKenna College studying Economics and Data Science. <br/>
                In the past, I have led a team in which we designed a mini wordle and a stats project that studied the factors affecting Professor ratings and won. <br/>
                On campus, I am a <a href = "https://www.salvatoricenter.org/">Salvatori Center Research Assistant </a> and I am currently leading a research team in which we are studying the reentry programs for prisoners. I am also a Career Service mentor at <a href = "https://www.cmc.edu/career-services">Soll Center for Student Opportunity</a>. In this role, I help students build their resumes, cover letters, and help the career coaches with administrative tasks.<br/>
                I am passionate about the tech industry because it is dynamic. To explore my passion for tech, I am enjoying a web development club where I have been learning web design using CSS, React, MangoDB and <a href = "https://www.p-ai.org/Project"> AI workshops </a>where I am learning the fundamentals of AI and Machine Learning.
                <br/>I am passionate about the technology industry and I am looking for more experience in product management, SWE, and data science-related fields like Artificial Intelligence or Machine Learning. <br/>One fun fact about me is that I enjoy cooking and baking. I wanted to share my passion with a like-minded community on campus so I founded a <a href ="https://www.instagram.com/claremontculinaryclub/">Culinary Club</a> on campus in which we have biweekly meetings where we cook or bake savory/sweet food.

                        <h2> Designed a Mini-Wordle</h2>
                        <p>I designed mini-Wordle. It's a mini version because it's dictionary is smaller than the actual wordle. I think this is nicer because it is much easier to guess a word. </p>
